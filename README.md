# KnowingBooks

- This is a book description web app. It's like IMDB but for books.

- The UI displays a list of books along with their description and corresponding ratings. 

- The Users can browse through the list of books efficiently due to the single page functionality. 

- The data displayed is not hard-coded. Rather it's being fetched from a local JSON-server in JSON format. 

- Users have access to a template-driven angular form, although authentication and back-end connection is yet to be implemented.

- The users can send feedback to the admins via the contact us form which is designed using reactive forms support of angular.

- Rating and commenting functionality on individual books is provided and the feedback is posted on the json-server through HTTP support in angular.
