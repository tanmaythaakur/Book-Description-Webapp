        description: 'Now in this much-anticipated sequel, Peterson goes further, showing that part of life\'s meaning comes from reaching out into the domain beyond what we know, and adapting to an ever-transforming world. While an excess of chaos threatens us with uncertainty, an excess of order leads to a lack of curiosity and creative vitality.'
